My content was migrated from MSDN to the DevBlogs "HeyScriptingGuys" after the shut down. In order to have more control or my content, my new content will be written in this blog on GitHub Pages. This landing page will link to a lot of content previously written for DevBlogs.

## Who is this series for?

People comfortable in PowerShell, looking to learn more about working with different kinds of text data.

1. [Inserting new elements into XML files](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/inserting-new-elements-into-xml-files/)
1. [Working with JSON data in PowerShell](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/working-with-json-data-in-powershell/)
1. [Grabbing Excel (XLSX) values with PowerShell](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/grabbing-excel-xlsx-values-with-powershell/)
    - I now use [this module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ImportExcel/7.1.0) created by Douglas Finke, which is updated regularly and has a ton of useful cmdlets. 

Let me know what other kind of data you'd like to see posts about!
